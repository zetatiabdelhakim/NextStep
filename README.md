# Next-Step Orientation

## Introduction
NEXT-STEP is a platform designed to help students at different educational levels choose the right school and academic path. This project aims to bridge the gap between students' interests and career opportunities, ensuring a fulfilling and successful professional future.

## Problematic
Many students struggle to determine their area of interest and find a suitable career path. This can be due to a lack of professional experience, unfamiliarity with various sectors, and the wide range of available options. Making a connection between their passions and real career opportunities is crucial for long-term well-being and professional success.

For high school students, choosing a school and determining the best path to study a field of interest can be overwhelming. University students may also face difficulties in knowing their true interests, which can lead to choosing fields that do not genuinely engage them. This lack of engagement can negatively impact their academic success and long-term job satisfaction.
